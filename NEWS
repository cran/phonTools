Several new functions have been added, including functionality to easily plot
IPA vowels 'out of the box', an interactive function that allows the user
to choose vowels for plotting and a function that converts x-sampa to values
that can be used to plot using IPA. It might need some tweaking to get IPA
symbols to export to pdf, however, it works fine when exporting plots as image
files and has been tested on Linux, Mac and Windows operating systems. At the
moment only vowels are supported, the rest of the IPA chart is coming soon. 

Several vowel data sets have been added to the package, and all vowel
categories are now represented using x-sampa. 

A few functions have also been added to allow LPC analysis and formant 
estimation, and to inspect the frequency response of digital filters. See the 
change log for a full listing of changes.
